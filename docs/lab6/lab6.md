# Teams
With Secret Server teams, administrators can create special groups called teams to restrict what users can see. A team bundles users and groups to assign them the same rules as to what other users and sites are visible to them. For example, a managed service provider could isolate their customers from seeing other customerâ€™s user accounts or a large company could "firewall" their users by department. Site visibility can also be restricted by teams. 

The scenario we are solving is that Dennis Hughes and Joe Bloggs, even though they can see all Windows Servers in the Secret Server instance, we want to limit their view on the use of the Server Team - Domain Admin secret to allow only one server. Also they can not have the choice of selecting which Proxy to use for the connection as that might lead into issues for them when they selected the wrong one and more WAN traffic, or even errors might occur. The rest of the IT Admins have to have normal use, not limited by anything.

Use the below diagram to understand what is being configured in this lab.

## Changing the Secret Template
As the existing secret Server team - Domain Admin secret has been created using a specific Secret Template, changes need to be made. The outcome should be that the people in the IT team can see and use the secret with no limitation. Joe Bloggs and Dennis Hughes (a Junior Admin) should have a limitation to a secret. These changes are:

- Change the Secret Template that has been used while the Server team - Domain Admin was created
- Change the Group membership that Dennis Hughes has been assigned to in AD. This has been a mistake.
- Create a secret that uses the restricted list for its Launcher

1. Log in the Secret Server UI as **ss-admin** and navigate to **Secrets >> > IT Team > IT - Server Team > Thylab**
2. Check the **Server Team - Domain Admin** and click **Bul Actions** in the bottom of the screen
